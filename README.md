Python Network Wifi Steal Script
this script works with windows 10 and will dump all the wifi pwd from a machine and send over email to your gmail.

You can also create an exe with pyinstaller

Actually is undetectable by any Windows Defender or Anti Virus as a threat.

if you want to help and create more scripts like this write to uktechmike@gmail.com


Could this script be a threat for windows and spread over internet sending wifi pwd to all the address book from an outlook client ?

Please help to develop this to spread over internet as the first wifi virus around the world
